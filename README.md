# textbasedrpg
First cpp project to test out some stuff I learned.

I hope to expand on my knowledge of C++ and create a text-based RPG game. I will be using this repository to store my code and track my progress.

I plan to publish this to peer review sites at the end of creation in hopes of receiving feedback on my code and how I can improve it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you find it interesting.

Best,
Kade Sanzo
