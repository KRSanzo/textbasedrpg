My goal for this game is to recreate some functionality and game mechanics associated with my favorite MMORPG, World of Warcraft. This is story based, but I wrote it
so that the story is different every time. Quests guide you to where the main story goes, but my goal is creating an "Open World" on paper.
Creating replayability, speedrunning-ability, and also providing multiple save options with different characters will allow the game to be enjoyed for many rounds to come.

Main Hubs for Classes:
  Celestarc : Mage Academy
  Training Grounds: Warrior School
  Lookout Point: Rogue Camp
  Verdant Manor: Rich Area of Village // Cleric Academy
  Imperial Market: Buy and Sell Goods

Combat System:
- Each Class has 4 abilities, varying per class. Talents will be unlocked at a certain level to either swap or buff these abilities.
- "Pokemon-Style Combat" where player has the ability to choose an action per turn, either using ability or using item from bag.
- If player dies at any time, respawn will be at last save point, or beginning if no save point is found.
- Mobs will be randomly generated with varying stats (HP, Abilities) based on level. Experience rewarded will vary based on level and level difference between player and mob.
    - Quest mobs will have chance to drop quest items, not guaranteed
 
Zone Locks:
- Zones will be accessible if two requirements are met, both level and intro quest to move to new zone.
- There are 4 zones: Village of Tranquillo, Luna Lake, The Verdant Grove, and the Hollow Depths.
- Introduction will vary based on class and random events occurring.

Random Drop Chances:
- There will be a random chance to spawn chests, and loot is also randomized between items on the loot table of particular mob.
- Chance to Earn Titles based off of special rewards
- Chance to die at any point based off of random chance and progress through the story

Inventory and Weapon System:
- Inventory will allow store and use of items, also currency
- Ability to Equip Weapon based on class, will provide extra statistics to either boost or change damage dealing/healing abilities
- Inventory space will be capped, items with same name currently do not have the ability to "stack"
